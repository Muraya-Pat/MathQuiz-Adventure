# MathQuiz Adventure

MathQuiz Adventure is a simple educational game I created to make learning math fun and accessible. Players solve math challenges to progress through unique levels, blending problem-solving with light adventure elements.

This project reflects my genuine passion for using games as a tool for learning. Educational technology is a powerful way to engage learners and help them build confidence in subjects like mathematics. My hope is that MathQuiz Adventure makes math less intimidating and more enjoyable for anyone who plays.
